# Declarative Components Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice writing dumb components in React

## Overview

If it's not obvious yet, I think this concept is really important for students
to get down. We want to give them as much practice as possible writing and
refactoring their programs to be more declarative: to depend less on the
incidentals of state etc.
